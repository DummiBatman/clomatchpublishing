Well, then you've come to the right place.
"Outfit Of the Week" is a program that
Clomatch has started in order to ensure
that everyone can express themselves
in the form of short-form content,
similar to that of YouTube Shorts
or TikTok.

The way it works is simple:
You submit a photo of your
outfit via the "Social" tab 
on the app. You will then be 
directed to the "Outfit of the Week"
social page. This page will look
similar to YouTube Shorts, TikTok,
or Instagram Reels. Features such as
liking, commenting, and sharing will be
available. However, commenting can
be disabled by the user if they wish
(via the settings tab).

At the end of each week (Friday @4pm EST),
the top 10 contestants of Outfit Of
the Week are selected by the Clomatch
Team. These are the videos/photos
that have the most likes. A poll
will then be released the following day
to decide who the winner is. Anybody who
wins will receive the "Outfit Of the Week Winner" 
gold badge on their profile. They will also receive a creator's
tag, which is important for the
"Outfit Of the Month". All of the
top ten contestants will receive
an "Outfit Of the Week" silver badge
on their profile.

However, you don't have to limit your
creativity just to one app. We suggest
that you post your outfit on other social
media platforms as well. This may give your
outfit more exposure and increase your likes.
Make sure to use the hashtag #ClomatchOOTW
so that your followers know where they can
support you.

        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">Outfit Of the Month</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;">Remember that creator's tag
that we briefly talked about.
Well, here is where you can use it.
Outfit of the Month is a program
that allows creators to inspire others'
videos. Creators are made up of certified
content creators on other channels, partnered
celebrities, and the winners of "Outfit Of the Week".
In "Outfit Of the Month", these creators have
to compete in order to win the grand prize of $500.
They also get the "Outfit Of the Month" winner 
platinum badge, which they can show off on their 
profile. However, don't get too comfortable
with the badge, because it will be taken away
and given to the next winner (unless you win again).

On the last day of every month, the "Outfit Of the Month"
restarts. Throughout the first week of the month, creators can submit
their outfits. Each submission will be reviewed
and then posted on the "Outfit Of the Month" page.
A poll will then be released on the first day of
of the second week. The day after, the winner
will be announced. The winner will receive the
grand prize of $500 and the platinum badge.
For the rest of the month, the "Reflect
Outfit Of the Month" page will be up. On
this page, anybody will be able to upload
content that was inspired by the winner's
outfit. The top ten users with the most likes
on this page will receive the "Reflect" badge.
